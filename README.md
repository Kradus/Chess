# Chess

This little program serves me as a portfolio.

It is a command based chess program and is written in Java 8 with the Spring framework.

This chess program supports all rules of chess. This means e.g.:
* The program finds out if somebody win
* The program finds out if it is drawn. This can be e.g. when both have not enough figure to set the other player checkmate or when 50 turns no pawn was set or a figure was hit. (For every drawn type exist a specific message.)
* You can switch your pawn against an other figure when it reaches the baseline of the other player.
* It supports castling and en passant

For starting you can use the "start.bat" file for Windows or the "start.sh" file for Linux.

When you want a list of the commands please type in "help" in the running program. The game can only be reset if a match is finished.

The view language of this program is only English because it has no I18n support.

If there are any questions about the program you are welcome to ask me.
