# Chess

This program is a command based chess program and is written in Java 8 with the Spring framework. It supports all rules of chess which are e.g.:
* The program finds out if somebody win
* Also knows it different types of draw. Furthermore exist for every type a specific message. A draw can happen e.g. when both players has only his king left or when 50 turns long no pawn was set or a figure was hit.
* When a pawn reach the baseline of the other player, he can change it to an other figure.
* It supports castling and en passant
