# Chess

This little program serves me as a portfolio.

The program is a command based chess program and is written with Java 8 and the Spring framework.

This chess program supports all rules of chess. This means e.g.:
-the program find outs if somebody win
-the program find out if it is drawn. This can be e.g. when both have not enough figure to set the other player checkmate or when 50 turns no pawn was set or a figure was hit. (It has for every drawn type a extra message.)
-you can switch your pawn against an other figure when it reach the baseline of the other player.
-it support castling and en passant

For starting you can use the "start.bat" file for Windows or the "start.sh" file for Linux.

The view language of this program is only English because it has no I18n support.

If there are any questions about the program you can ask me in a personal conversation or by phone or e-mail.
